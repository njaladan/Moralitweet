# Moralitweet

Moralitweet is a small web app (written almost completely in Javascript) that uses data from several surveys to compute what the morality of a person's tweets are. It should be said that morality is a pretty tough issue whose nuances cannot be understood through just sentiment analysis. However, if you're like to read my original write-up on the topic, you can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N7MFNlqo5U6jwlrNEGdzrkh1xvHNniLwMD-slK9vnUU/edit).

I originally quickly wrote this for a small project in my AP English Language class to demonstrate certain points of morality that we had been discussing in class. As a result, most of the code isn't well-commented and is placed rather densely as a large block of inline JavaScript in the `index.html` file.

For those interested in seeing how it works, simply `git clone` the repo and place your Twitter and Mashape authentication keys in the appropriate places in the file. Feel free to contact me for any help.
